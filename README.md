# KingCounty_PredicitveModel

Analyzed data and classified home prices into 3 different types: Low, Medium, High.
Preprocessed data using caret (an R language package for Machine Learning) to remove predictors that have low
variance and that are highly correlated. Predictor variables were transformed to reduce skewness.
Data was split into training and test set (80:20). Model was trained on training set and the performance of the model
was evaluated on test set.
Trained models using Linear Discriminant Analysis and Neural Networks.
Install Caret package before running the code in R.
